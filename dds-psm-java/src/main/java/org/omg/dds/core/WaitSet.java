/**
 * A WaitSet object allows an application to wait until one or more of the
 * attached {@link Condition} objects has a triggerValue of true or else until
 * the timeout expires.
 * 
 * WaitSet is not necessarily associated with a single
 * {@link org.omg.dds.domain.DomainParticipant} and could be used to wait on
 * Condition objects
 * associated with different DomainParticipant objects.
 * 
 * This mechanism is wait-based. Its general use pattern is as follows:
 * 
 * <ul>
 *     <li>The application indicates which relevant information it wants to
 *         get by creating {@link Condition} objects
 *         ({@link StatusCondition}, {@link org.omg.dds.sub.ReadCondition} or
 *         {@link org.omg.dds.sub.QueryCondition}) and attaching them to a
 *          WaitSet.</li>
 *     <li>It then waits on that WaitSet until the triggerValue of one or
 *         several Condition objects become true.</li>
 *     <li>It then uses the result of the wait (i.e., the list of Condition
 *         objects with triggerValue == true) to actually get the information
 *         by calling:<ul>
 *         <li>{@link Entity#getStatusChanges()} and then
 *             <code>get&lt;<i>CommunicationStatus</i>&gt;</code> on the
 *             relevant Entity.</li>
 *         <li>{@link Entity#getStatusChanges()} and then
 *             {@link org.omg.dds.sub.Subscriber#getDataReaders(Collection)}
 *             on the relevant Subscriber.</li>
 *         <li>{@link Entity#getStatusChanges()} and then
 *             {@link org.omg.dds.sub.DataReader#read()}/
 *             {@link org.omg.dds.sub.DataReader#take()} on the
 *             relevant DataReader.</li>
 *         <li>Directly call
 *             {@link org.omg.dds.sub.DataReader#read(org.omg.dds.sub.DataReader.Selector)}/
 *             {@link org.omg.dds.sub.DataReader#take(org.omg.dds.sub.DataReader.Selector)}
 *             with the {@link org.omg.dds.sub.DataReader.Selector} wrapping a
 *             ReadCondition or a QueryCondition.</li>
 *         </ul></li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * Usually the first step is done in an initialization phase, while the
 * others are put in the application main loop.
 * 
 * As there is no extra information passed from the middleware to the
 * application when a wait returns (only the list of triggered Condition
 * objects), Condition objects are meant to embed all that is needed to react
 * properly when enabled. In particular, Entity-related conditions are
 * related to exactly one Entity and cannot be shared.
 * 
 * The blocking behavior of the WaitSet is described below. The result of a
 * {@link #waitForConditions()} operation depends on the state of the
 * WaitSet, which in turn depends on whether at least one attached Condition
 * has a triggerValue of true. If the {@link #waitForConditions()} operation
 * is called on WaitSet that is blocked, it will block the calling thread.
 * If {@link #waitForConditions()} is called on a WaitSet that is unblocked,
 * it will return immediately. In addition, when the WaitSet transitions from
 * BLOCKED to UNBLOCKED it wakes up any threads that had called
 * {@link #waitForConditions()} on it.
 * 
 * Similar to the invocation of listeners, there is no implied "event
 * queuing" in the awakening of a WaitSet in the sense that, if several
 * Conditions attached to the WaitSet have their triggerValue transition to
 * true in sequence the DCPS implementation needs to only unblock the WaitSet
 * once.
