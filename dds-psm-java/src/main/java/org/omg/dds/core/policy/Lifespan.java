/**
 * Specifies the maximum duration of validity of the data written by the
 * {@link DataWriter}. The default value of the lifespan duration is infinite.
 * 
 * <b>Concerns:</b> {@link Topic}, {@link DataWriter}
 * 
 * <b>RxO:</b> N/A
 * 
 * <b>Changeable:</b> Yes
 * 
 * The purpose of this QoS is to avoid delivering "stale" data to the
 * application.
 * 
 * Each data sample written by the DataWriter has an associated "expiration
 * time" beyond which the data should not be delivered to any application.
 * Once the sample expires, the data will be removed from the DataReader
 * caches as well as from the transient and persistent information caches.
 * 
 * The "expiration time" of each sample is computed by adding the duration
 * specified by the LIFESPAN QoS to the source time stamp. As described in
 * {@link DataWriter#write(Object)} and
 * {@link DataWriter#write(Object, org.omg.dds.core.Time)}, the source time
 * stamp is either automatically computed by the Service each time the
 * write operation is called, or else supplied by the application.
 * 
 * This QoS relies on the sender and receiving applications having their
 * clocks sufficiently synchronized. If this is not the case and the Service
 * can detect it, the DataReader is allowed to use the reception time stamp
 * instead of the source time stamp in its computation of the "expiration
 * time."
