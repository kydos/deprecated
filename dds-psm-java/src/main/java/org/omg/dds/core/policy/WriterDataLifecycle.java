/**
 * Specifies the behavior of the {@link DataWriter} with regards to the life
 * cycle of the data instances it manages.
 * 
 * <b>Concerns:</b> {@link DataWriter}
 * 
 * <b>RxO:</b> N/A
 * 
 * <b>Changeable:</b> Yes
 * 
 * This policy controls the behavior of the DataWriter with regards to the
 * lifecycle of the data instances it manages, that is, the data instances
 * that have been either explicitly registered with the DataWriter using the
 * {@link DataWriter#registerInstance(Object)} operations or implicitly by
 * directly writing the data (see {@link DataWriter#write(Object)}).
 * 
 * The autodisposeUnregisteredInstances flag controls the behavior when the
 * DataWriter unregisters an instance by means of the
 * {@link DataWriter#unregisterInstance(org.omg.dds.core.InstanceHandle)}
 * operations:
 * 
 * <ul>
 *     <li>The setting "autodisposeUnregisteredInstances = true' causes the
 *         DataWriter to dispose the instance each time it is unregistered.
 *         The behavior is identical to explicitly calling one of the
 *         {@link DataWriter#dispose(org.omg.dds.core.InstanceHandle)}
 *         operations on the instance prior to calling the unregister
 *         operation.</li>
 * 
 *     <li>The setting 'autodisposeUnregisteredInstances = false' will not
 *         cause this automatic disposition upon unregistering. The
 *         application can still call one of the dispose operations prior to
 *         unregistering the instance and accomplish the same effect.
 *         Refer to Section 7.1.3.23.3 of the DDS specification, "Semantic
 *         difference between unregister_instance and dispose", for a
 *         description of the consequences of disposing and unregistering
 *         instances.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * Note that the deletion of a DataWriter automatically unregisters all data
 * instances it manages (see {@link DataWriter#close()}). Therefore the
 * setting of the autodisposeUnregisteredInstances flag will determine
 * whether instances are ultimately disposed when the DataWriter is deleted
 * either directly by means of the {@link DataWriter#close()} operation or
 * indirectly as a consequence of calling
 * {@link Publisher#closeContainedEntities()} or
 * {@link DomainParticipant#closeContainedEntities()}.
