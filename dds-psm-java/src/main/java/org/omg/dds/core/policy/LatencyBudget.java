/**
 * Specifies the maximum acceptable delay from the time the data is written
 * until the data is inserted in the receiver's application cache and the
 * receiving application is notified of the fact. This policy is a hint to
 * the Service, not something that must be monitored or enforced. The Service
 * is not required to track or alert the user of any violation. The default
 * value of the duration is zero indicating that the delay should be
 * minimized.
 * 
 * <b>Concerns:</b> {@link Topic}, {@link DataReader}, {@link DataWriter}
 * 
 * <b>RxO:</b> Yes
 * 
 * <b>Changeable:</b> Yes
 * 
 * This policy provides a means for the application to indicate to the
 * middleware the "urgency" of the data communication. By having a non-zero
 * duration the Service can optimize its internal operation.
 * 
 * This policy is considered a hint. There is no specified mechanism as to
 * how the service should take advantage of this hint.
 * 
 * The value offered is considered compatible with the value requested if and
 * only if the inequality "offered duration <= requested duration" evaluates
 * to true.
