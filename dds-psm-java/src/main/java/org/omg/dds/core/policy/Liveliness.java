/**
 * Determines the mechanism and parameters used by the application to
 * determine whether an {@link Entity} is "active" (alive). The "liveliness"
 * status of an Entity is used to maintain instance ownership in combination
 * with the setting of the {@link Ownership}. The application is
 * also informed via an Entity {@link Status} change when an Entity is no
 * longer alive. The {@link DataReader} requests that liveliness of the
 * writers is maintained by the requested means and loss of liveliness is
 * detected with delay not to exceed the leaseDuration. The {@link DataWriter}
 * commits to signaling its liveliness using the stated means at intervals
 * not to exceed the leaseDuration. The default kind is
 * {@link Liveliness.Kind#AUTOMATIC} and the default value of the
 * leaseDuration is infinite.
 * 
 * <b>Concerns:</b> {@link Topic}, {@link DataReader}, {@link DataWriter}
 * 
 * <b>RxO:</b> Yes
 * 
 * <b>Changeable:</b> No
 * 
 * This policy has several settings to support both data objects that are
 * updated periodically as well as those that are changed sporadically. It
 * also allows customizing for different application requirements in terms of
 * the kinds of failures that will be detected by the liveliness mechanism.
 * 
 * The {@link Kind#AUTOMATIC} liveliness setting is most appropriate for
 * applications that only need to detect failures at the process level, but
 * not application-logic failures within a process. The Service takes
 * responsibility for renewing the leases at the required rates and thus, as
 * long as the local process where a {@link DomainParticipant} is running and
 * the link connecting it to remote participants remains connected, the
 * entities within the DomainParticipant will be considered alive. This
 * requires the lowest overhead.
 * 
 * The MANUAL settings ({@link Kind#MANUAL_BY_PARTICIPANT},
 * {@link Kind#MANUAL_BY_TOPIC}) require the application on the publishing
 * side to periodically assert the liveliness before the lease expires to
 * indicate the corresponding Entity is still alive. The action can be
 * explicit by calling the <code>assertLiveliness</code> operations
 * ({@link DataWriter#assertLiveliness()},
 * {@link DomainParticipant#assertLiveliness()}) or implicit by writing some
 * data.
 * 
 * The two possible manual settings control the granularity at which the
 * application must assert liveliness.
 * 
 * <ul>
 *      <li>The setting MANUAL_BY_PARTICIPANT requires only that one Entity
 *          within the publisher is asserted to be alive to deduce all other
 *          Entity objects within the same DomainParticipant are also alive.
 *      <li>The setting MANUAL_BY_TOPIC requires that at least one instance
 *          within the DataWriter is asserted.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * The value offered is considered compatible with the value requested if and
 * only if the following conditions are met:
 * 
 * <ol>
 *      <li>the inequality "offered kind &gt;= requested kind" evaluates to
 *          true. For the purposes of this inequality, the values of
 *          LIVELINESS kind are considered ordered such that:
 *          <code>AUTOMATIC &lt; MANUAL_BY_PARTICIPANT &lt; MANUAL_BY_TOPIC
 *          </code>.</li>
 *      <li>the inequality "offered leaseDuration <= requested
 *          leaseDuration" evaluates to true.</li>
 * </ol>
 * 
 * Changes in LIVELINESS must be detected by the Service with a
 * time granularity greater or equal to the leaseDuration. This ensures that
 * the value of the {@link LivelinessChangedStatus} is updated at least once
 * during each leaseDuration and the related Listeners and {@link WaitSet}s
 * are notified within a leaseDuration from the time the LIVELINESS changed.
