/**
 * User data not known by the middleware, but distributed by means of
 * built-in topics. The default value is an empty (zero-sized) sequence.
 * 
 * <b>Concerns:</b> {@link Publisher}, {@link Subscriber}
 * 
 * <b>RxO:</b> No
 * 
 * <b>Changeable:</b> Yes
 * 
 * The purpose of this QoS is to allow the application to attach additional
 * information to the created {@link Publisher} or {@link Subscriber}. The
 * value of the GROUP_DATA is available to the application on the
 * {@link DataReader} and {@link DataWriter} entities and is propagated by
 * means of the built-in topics.
 * 
 * This QoS can be used by an application combination with the
 * {@link DataReaderListener} and {@link DataWriterListener} to implement
 * matching policies similar to those of the {@link Partition}
 * except the decision can be made based on an application-defined policy.
