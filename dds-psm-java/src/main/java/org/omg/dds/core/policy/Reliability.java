/**
 * This policy indicates the level of reliability requested by a
 * {@link DataReader} or offered by a {@link DataWriter}. These levels are
 * ordered, {@link Kind#BEST_EFFORT} being lower than {@link Kind#RELIABLE}.
 * A DataWriter offering a level is implicitly offering all levels below.
 * 
 * <b>Concerns:</b> {@link Topic}, {@link DataReader}, {@link DataWriter}
 * 
 * <b>RxO:</b> Yes
 * 
 * <b>Changeable:</b> No
 * 
 * The setting of this policy has a dependency on the setting of the
 * {@link ResourceLimits}. In case the RELIABILITY kind is set to
 * RELIABLE the {@link DataWriter#write(Object)} operation may block if the
 * modification would cause data to be lost or else cause one of the limits
 * specified in the RESOURCE_LIMITS to be exceeded. Under these circumstances,
 * the RELIABILITY maxBlockingTime configures the maximum duration the write
 * operation may block.
 * 
 * If the RELIABILITY kind is set to RELIABLE, data samples originating from
 * a single DataWriter cannot be made available to the DataReader if there
 * are previous data samples that have not been received yet due to a
 * communication error. In other words, the service will repair the error and
 * retransmit data samples as needed in order to reconstruct a correct
 * snapshot of the DataWriter history before it is accessible by the
 * DataReader.
 * 
 * If the RELIABILITY kind is set to BEST_EFFORT, the service will not
 * retransmit missing data samples. However, for data samples originating
 * from any one DataWriter the service will ensure they are stored in the
 * DataReader history in the same order they originated in the DataWriter. In
 * other words, the DataReader may miss some data samples but it will never
 * see the value of a data object change from a newer value to an older value.
 * 
 * The value offered is considered compatible with the value requested if and
 * only if the inequality "offered kind &gt;= requested kind" evaluates to
 * true. For the purposes of this inequality, the values of RELIABILITY kind
 * are considered ordered such that BEST_EFFORT &lt; RELIABLE.
