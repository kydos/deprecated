/**
 * The DomainParticipant object plays several roles:
 * <ul>
 * <li>It acts as a container for all other {@link Entity} objects.</li>
 * <li>It acts as factory for the {@link Publisher}, {@link Subscriber},
 *     {@link Topic}, {@link ContentFilteredTopic}, and {@link MultiTopic}
 *     objects.</li>
 * <li>It represents the participation of the application on a communication
 *     plane that isolates applications running on the same set of physical
 *     computers from each other. A domain establishes a "virtual network"
 *     linking all applications that share the same domainId and isolating
 *     them from applications running on different domains. In this way,
 *     several independent distributed applications can coexist in the same
 *     physical network without interfering, or even being aware of each
 *     other.</li>
 * <li>It provides administration services in the domain, offering operations
 *     that allow the application to "ignore" locally any information about a
 *     given participant ({@link #ignoreParticipant(InstanceHandle)}),
 *     publication ({@link #ignorePublication(InstanceHandle)}),
 *     subscription ({@link #ignoreSubscription(InstanceHandle)}), or topic
 *     ({@link #ignoreTopic(InstanceHandle)}).</li>
