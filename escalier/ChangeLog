	* src/main/scala/dds/sub/Samples.scala: Changed sample2Data
	implicit conversion to return an IndexedSeqOptimized as opposed to
	an Iterator.

	* Updated read/take methods on the DataReader to give access to the
	sample info along with the sample data. An implicit conversion allows
	to use the read/take as in the previous API.

	* Moved escalier to Scala v2.9.2

	* Released version 0.3

	* Added file-transfer  example 
	
	* Updated examples to use the new QoS DSL



	* Updated QoS DSL to use case objects as opposed to case classes
	when appropriate. In addition the various options for a QoS Policy
	now are nested into the QoS companion.  For example, in place of
	KeepLastHistory(), now you'll have to use History.KeepLast. Notice
	that the latter is a singleton.
