Escalier is a prototype Scala API (see www.scala-lang.org) for
OpenSplice DDS (see http://www.opensplice.org).

Escalier is built as a layer above the existing OpenSplice DDS Java
API and tries to expose the DDS API in a concise and elegant manner
exploting the nice features of the Scala Programming Language
