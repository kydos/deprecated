[Qos Policy]

   - Define constant objects for representing alternatives. This will
   save memory and time.

   - QoS policies should implement the Comparable interface.

[Entities QoS]

   - Define a method "with" for each accepted QoS Policy. Let this method
   return a QoS so that they can be chained as follows:

      TopicQos = (new TopicQos())
        .with(Realiability.Reliable())
        .with(Durability.Transient());


   - Entites QoS should implement the comparable interface


[Time & Duration]
   - Have to implement Comparable!
