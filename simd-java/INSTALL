0. DEPENDENCIES

In order to use simd-java you need the following software packages:

   - OpenSplice DDS (http://www.opensplice.org)

   - Simple Build Tool (https://github.com/harrah/xsbt/wiki/Getting-Started-Setup) 

   - Scala (http://www.scala-lang.org)

Notice that the dependency on SBT brings the dependency on Scala as well.
This could be a bit annoying from those users that don't use already Scala,
and we might add good support for maven soon.

However, since you'll have to install scala to compile simd-java, you
might also want to give a try at Escalier, the Scala API for 
DDS (https://github.com/kydos/escalier).




1. CONFIGURING

In order to configure simd-java, assuming you have installed the
software packages listed in the previous section, you need to simply
do the following:

$ ./configure


2. COMPILING

To compile simd-java you need to run the following command:

$ sbt compile

then if you want to create the jar packages for the library you
run the command:

$ sbt package


3. RUNNING EXAMPLES

To run the examples you simply have to type:

$ sbt
Then you'll see the SBT prompt:

[info] Loading project definition from /some-path/simd-java/project
[info] Set current project to simd-java (in build file:/some-path/simd-java/)
> 

At this point type:

> run

You will see the list of applications:

Multiple main classes detected, select one to run:

 [1] org.opensplice.webcast.randomshapes.ShapesReader
 [2] org.opensplice.demo.ping.PingSubscriber
 [3] org.opensplice.demo.ping.PingPublisher
 [4] org.opensplice.webcast.randomshapes.ShapesWriter
 [5] org.opensplice.demo.shapes.Javashapes

Enter number: 


At this point you simply enter the number of the application you
want to run. Clearly if you want to see some Pub/Sub in action
you'll have to start multiple applications, thus you'll have to
repeat the exercise described above at least another time.

Enjoy!
